DESCRIPTION
	Folder of the Client-Server application that resembles a Cloud Storage built in C++ (using OpenSSL) for the Foundations of Cybersecurity project at the University of Pisa.
	This application, created for university purposes (realised during a Master's degree in AIDE), is focused on cybersecurity. 
	For this reason, some aspects will not be complete or will be simplified compared to a real commercial cloud storage.
	In this application: each user has a “dedicated storage” on the server, and any user cannot access the “dedicated storage” of any other user. 
	Users can Upload, Download, Rename, or Delete data to/from the Cloud Storage in a safe manner.

The folder contains:
	- 

Developer's notes:
	The work related to the university examination is not yet finished and the project is not yet completed. 
	There may be updates or improvements to the project in the future, but nothing is planned for now.
